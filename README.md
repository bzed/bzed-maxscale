## Overview

MariaDB MaxScale is an open-source, database-centric proxy that works with
MariaDB Enterprise, MariaDB 5.5, MariaDB 10 and Oracle MySQLÂ®. It has a
pluggable architecture designed to increase flexibility and aid customization
as well as a lightweight, high-speed networking core designed to facilitate
throughput.

## Module Description

This module will install MaxScale. More might be implemented later,
but for now setting up apt repositories and installing the package on
Debian/Ubuntu are the only supported features.

  ** FIXME **

## Setup

### What maxscale affects

* On Debian based systems this module will add a new apt key and sources list
  using the puppetlabs-apt module. In case you are using a different way to
  manage apt please ensure that your module won't conflict with
  puppetlabs-apt.

### Setup Requirements

For $::osfamily == 'Debian' the puppetlabs-apt module is required.
